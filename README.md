Thank you for reading the [Succinctly Series](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks).

## Importing the Flow

Just open the flow as a text file within any text editor of your choice. Then, copy all the content of the file, and paste it inside an empty flow within Power Automate Desktop, and save the flow.
